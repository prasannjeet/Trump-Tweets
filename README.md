# Trump-Tweets
Part of a coding meet-up exercise by Sigma in Vaxjo Sweden.

A Json file was provided with all the tweets by Donald Trump and we were supposed to carry out some basic operations.

**Questions**
> - Count the total number of tweets.
> - Count the number of tweets that were not from iPhone.
> - Find out the Maximum Favorites on a single tweet.
> - Count the highest Favorite on a single tweet.
> *For the last part, since any retweet has 0 favorites, my code always returned 0, and I kept thinking there is some problem with my code!! Lost a lot of time here and couldn't solve it further*
> - Don't remember other questions, but it had to do something with visually representing favorites, etc.
